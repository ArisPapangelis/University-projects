# Fuzzy Systems
 Code for the four assignments during the course Fuzzy Systems
 
 ## Assignment 1
 Controlling a DC motor with a fuzzy logic controller. Three scenarios in Simulink.
 
 ## Assignment 2
 Controlling the movement of a virtual vehicle with a fuzzy logic controller. The task is obstacle avoidance.
 
 ## Assignment 3
 Using a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy inference system to solve a regression problem. 
 Airfoil self-noise dataset and superconductivity dataset from the UCI repository are used.
 
 ## Assignment 4
 Using a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy inference system to solve a classification problem. 
 Haberman's survival dataset and epileptic seizure recognition dataset from the UCI repository are used.
